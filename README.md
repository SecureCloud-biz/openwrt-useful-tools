Here you will find ALOT of different tools that i consider useful!  
There are seperate branches for different versions of OpenWRT which is running on either the WiFi Pineapple MK6 (*NANO*/*TETRA*) or the MK7 (*Hak5 Firmwares*)  
Packages for the curent live firmware for the Pineapple MK7 can be found at the 'main' **[packages-21.02_mkvii](https://github.com/adde88/openwrt-useful-tools/tree/packages-19.07_mkvi)** branch of this repo, which i will continue on updating!
